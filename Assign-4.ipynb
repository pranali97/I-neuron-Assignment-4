    "           the list's content. \n",

    "    Tuples:Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, we cannot modify\n",
    "            its elements. Once we define a tuple, we cannot add, remove, or change any elements in it.\n",
    "1. Syntax:\n",
    "        Lists: In most programming languages, lists are defined using square\n",
    "               brackets [ ]. For example: my_list = [1, 2, 3].\n",
    "        Tuples: Tuples are typically defined using parentheses ( ). For example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3).\n",

    "                are also used as keys in dictionaries since they are immutable, unlike lists.\n",
